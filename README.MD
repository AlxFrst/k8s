## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase leverages infrastructure-as-code and utilizes Terraform to provision virtual machines on the Proxmox infrastructure. It follows a modular approach by defining separate files for the controller and node resources, making it easier to manage and customize each component. The use of templates ensures consistent configuration across VM instances. |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. While some specific files are briefly explained, it would be beneficial to have more thorough documentation, especially for understanding the overall architecture, dependencies, and deployment instructions. |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase heavily relies on Terraform and the Proxmox provider, which is used to interact with the Proxmox API for creating and configuring virtual machines. It also assumes the presence of Ubuntu templates for provisioning. |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase exhibits modularity by utilizing separate files for the controller and node resources, each focusing on provisioning a specific type of virtual machine. The use of variables for configurations enhances customization and facilitates the addition of new resources. |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase does not define explicit testing strategies or tools, indicating the absence of automated tests. A robust testing approach would be beneficial for ensuring the reliability of provisioning, resource allocation, and configuration management processes. |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | As an infrastructure provisioning codebase, the performance relies on the efficiency of Terraform and the Proxmox provider. Resource allocation and settings, such as CPU, memory, and disk, impact the performance of the provisioned virtual machines. Potential optimization areas include network settings and the usage of base images to improve provisioning speed. |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase does not explicitly demonstrate security measures through encryption or authentication mechanisms. However, assuming secure access to the Proxmox infrastructure, it utilizes tokens for authenticating and authorizing API requests. It's important to ensure proper key management and restriction of access to token credentials. |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase utilizes Git for version control, enabling collaboration and tracking changes over time. It benefits from the version control's branching and merging capabilities, allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of the infrastructure configuration. |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The codebase integrates with the Proxmox infrastructure by utilizing the Proxmox provider in Terraform. Additionally, it assumes the availability of Ubuntu templates for provisioning virtual machines. Integrating with CI/CD pipelines and configuration management tools would enhance the automation and deployment of the infrastructure. |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The codebase can support scalability by utilizing Terraform's declarative infrastructure provisioning. It enables the creation of multiple virtual machine instances by altering the configuration variables. Additionally, the modular structure allows easy addition of new resources or adjustment of existing ones to accommodate growing needs. |
